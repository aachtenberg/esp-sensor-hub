## 📋 How It Works (30-Second Cycle)

```
Device Boot
    ↓
Connect to WiFi
    ↓
Initialize DS18B20
    ↓
Start web server
    ↓
[EVERY 30 SECONDS]
    ├─ Read DS18B20 temperature
    ├─ Buffer all device logs (up to 50 entries)
    ├─ POST JSON to Lambda endpoint
    │  ├─ Device name
    │  ├─ Temperature (C & F)
    │  ├─ Timestamp
    │  └─ All buffered logs
    ├─ Receive HTTP 200 response
    ├─ Lambda processes and writes to CloudWatch
    ├─ Device clears log buffer
    └─ Serial output shows success
    ↓
Repeat indefinitely (24/7)
```
